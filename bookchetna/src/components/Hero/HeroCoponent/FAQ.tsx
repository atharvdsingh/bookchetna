      question: "Is it safe to rent my books to strangers?",
      answer: "Yes! We verify all users through a secure identity check. Additionally, our platform holds a security deposit for every rental, ensuring your books are protected against loss or damage.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get paid for my rentals?",
      answer: "Earnings are deposited directly into your linked bank account or digital wallet once the rental period is successfully completed and the book is returned.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if a book is returned late?",
      answer: "Borrowers are charged a late fee for every extra day they keep the book. This fee is passed on to you as compensation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I set my own rental prices?",
      answer: "Absolutely. You have full control over the daily or weekly rental price. We provide suggested pricing based on the book's value and demand, but the final decision is yours.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a limit to how many books I can list?",
      answer: "No, there is no limit! Whether you have one book or a thousand, you can list as many as you like and turn your library into a source of income.",
